<p>By the time we realised what was happening, it was already too late.</p>
<p>As soon as I set foot in the FoodCorp Supermarket the cameras recognise me. The footage is streamed live to one of their dozen back-end analytics data centres. Facial recognition algorithms recognise my face from prior visits. This is confirmed by also analysing the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-06/chinese-gait-recognition-tech-ids-people-by-how-they-walk/10469974">gait of my walk</a> and my <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/5-ways-law-enforcement-will-use-tattoo-recognition-technology">unique tattoo</a>. Those servers look up their historical databases to find recordings and analytics from all my prior trips to a FoodCorp supermarket. This is when my Customer Journey&#8482; begins.</p>
<p>As I head to the snack aisle I see dozens of cameras overhead, watching silently. They're no longer just an anti-shoplifting measure. I walk past the gluten-free quinoa-based muesli bars. The cameras note this. They remember that I don't like that holier-than-thou health food. I reach to pick up a pack of BBQ chips, then pause and instead choose the prettier looking alternative next to it. The cameras note this. They know I just turned down my usual choice for something new. This triggers a back end algorithm which immediately sells the information about my choice to both chip makers. (Even though both are ultimately <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/companies-control-everything-you-buy-kelloggs-nestle-unilever-a7666731.html">owned by the same company</a>) Those brands won't pay much for that information alone, but they're getting more information than just my decision. They're getting a whole 1.2MB payload.</p>

<p>FoodCorp's servers dug deep into their data troves, and those of their partners, pulling up everything they know about me. They have already bought my demographic, social media and credit card information from <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/feature/2433/i-asked-online-tracking-company-all-my-data-and-heres-what-i-found">shady third party data brokers</a>. Aggregated together with video and analytics from all my prior visits they're able to paint a complete picture about me as a <del>person</del> customer.</p>
<p>The chip manufacturers' aren't the only ones who pay dearly for this data. My health insurer is also quite interested in my choice of afternoon snack.</p>
<p>FoodCorp claims that we all consent to having our data secretly extracted, aggregated and sold. Legally that's true. At the entrance to every FoodWorks store there is an inconspicuous ankle-height sign. It states that by entering the store, you agree to their Privacy Statement and End User Licence Agreement (EULA). The documents themselves don't appear at the store entrance, because each is about 10,000 words long. So anyone who actually noticed the sign would be clueless as to what they'd potentially be agreeing to.</p>
<p>However even if you did find the online copies and read them, it wouldn't make a difference. Section 17.3.2a of the EULA claims that it is &quot;Subject to change without notice&quot;. So you may agree to what seems to be reasonable terms on Tuesday. However FoodCorp can change their policies on Wednesday to <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw949v/lawyers-for-gta-online-get-court-order-to-search-homes-of-alleged-cheat-makers">allow them to enter your home</a> and look through your underwear drawer. You wouldn't legally be able to stop them. By entering any of their stores at some point in the past, you've become bound to a corporation's policy which is &quot;Subject to change without notice&quot;. What this amounts to is <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=feyUDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=after%20on&amp;pg=PT337#v=onepage&amp;q=privatization%20of%20the%20law&amp;f=false">the privatization of the law</a>.</p>
<p>FoodCorp claims that these &quot;auxillary revenue opportunities&quot; help them offer more competitive prices. However it's strange, my grocery bill doesn't seem any lower than before. The FoodCorp shareholders are happy though.</p>
<p>On my way to the checkout I pass a pair of FoodCorp <em>Customer Excellence Ambassadorsâ„¢</em>. (Formerly known as &quot;shelf stockers&quot;.) They're setting up the store's Christmas decorations. Each year they get a little bit earlier. It's currently late August.</p>
<p>After scanning the barcode on my bag of chips at the self checkout, I'm told the price is $4.80. Damn. The <a href="https://www.sunpaitag.com/supermarket-epaper-price-tag-13.html">e-paper price tag</a> on the shelf told me the chips only cost $4.10.</p>
<p>When FoodCorp first introduced dynamic prices they claimed that it was only a time-based market signal to incentivise shoppers <a href="https://thewest.com.au/lifestyle/shopping/supermarket-digital-tags-adjust-pricing-depending-on-time-of-day-bc-5486533651001">to shop outside the busy periods</a>. However there's no transparancy about when or why prices change. There was a court case a few years ago, alleging that FoodCorp's automated surveillance system temporarily increases prices based on the income of whoever is in that aisle, and whether they look like they're in a hurry. Unfortunately there's no way for any consumer group to prove it, because their proprietary pricing algorithms are <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/05/the_fallibility.html">hidden from the court</a> due to intellectual property laws.</p>
<p>None of the self checkout machines accept cash any more. The days of anonymous purchases without private middlemen are long gone. The government's competition watchdog put up no resistance to a for-profit duopoly taking over 100% of commercial transactions. They claim we still have choice. Hmm, do I want to be tracked by MasterCard or Visa? Both of those corporations have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/google-and-mastercard-cut-a-secret-ad-deal-to-track-retail-sales">data exchange deals with FoodCorp</a>. The card company hands over my income and spending habit data to FoodCorp. In exchange FoodCorp gives them detailed information about what I purchased, which aisles I visited, which items I looked at, and for how long.</p>
<p>The machine asks me if I want a digital receipt sent to me via email, SMS, Facebook Messenger, or the FoodCorp app. This is mostly so that they can discover yet another identifier to track me with.</p>
<p>Many shoppers still believe that physical shopping is anonymous. That unlike the online world, your behaviours and purchases aren't tracked and sold to advertising agencies and data brokers. But that's not true. Not any more.</p>
